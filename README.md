This theme is an attempt to have dark UI features such as tabs, title bar, and file tree, while at the same time having a light-themed editor window.

Currently I'm marking it as a "light" theme and overriding activityBar, sideBar, titleBar, tab, statusBar, etc.

I had it the other way around, starting with a "dark" theme and overriding editor colors. The main problem with that, though, was the text cursor color, which was almost invisible and not configurable.

_There is no acounting for taste, as they say._
